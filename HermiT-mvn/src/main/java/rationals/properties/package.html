A package containing various properties checkers on automaton objects, 
mainly simple unary tests and equivalence relations.
<h2>Documentation</h2>
This package offers the following unary tests on automaton:
<dl>
	<dd >emptiness: </dd> 
	<dt >checks if given automaton is empty</dt>
	<dd>normalized: </dd>
	<dt>checks if automaton as one start state with no incoming transitions 
and one end state, </dt> 
	<dd>contains epsilon: </dd>
	<dt >checks if the automaton recognizes the empty word epsilon, </dt>
</dl>
It also offers an extensible framework for computing equivalence 
relations over automata. The {@see rationals.properties.AreEquivalent} class
checks that starting states of both automata are equivalent according to
some {@see rationals.properties.Relation}. Predefined relation objects are;
<dl>
	<dd>Completed Trace equivalence: </dd>
	<dt>compute the equivalence of two states according to the language they 
	recognize, </dt>
	<dd>Weak Bisimulation: </dd>
	<dt>checks that two states produces the same labels and lead to equivalent states, 
	without taking into account epsilon transitions, </dt>
		<dd>(Strong) Bisimulation: </dd>
		<dt>checks that two states produces the same labels and lead to equivalent states, 
epsilon transitions are accounted for. </dt>
	<dd>Isomorphism: </dd>
	<dt>checks that two automaton are isomorph up to a renaming of states.</dt>
</dl>
Obviously, these equivalence relations are meaningful only when one does not want 
to compute the minimal DFA for a given automaton as in this case they all collapse
into (completed) trace equivalence.
